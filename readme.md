## Project Test calculator

I loved doing this project, since it is a technology that I had never heard of, stencil.js a compiler to make web components, obviously I know what typescript is but I had never worked on it in any project.
It was a total challenge for me and I will surely see this code in a couple of months when I start developing in this technology and I am going to laugh at it. The truth is that the documentation on the subject of handling events seems a bit complicated to me, but I think the concept of working with web components is very simple and practical to develop with quality and speed.
If you work with stencil I would love to receive your feedback.
Thank you very much
